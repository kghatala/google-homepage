### Basic html/css tutorial

I've been picking up some HTML/CSS and using exercises from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses?ref=home) as practice. This repository contains files associated with creating a (non-functional) Google homepage from scratch using HTML/CSS. For more information on the assignment click [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).
